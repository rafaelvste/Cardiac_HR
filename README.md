# Cardiac_HR
The codes in this repository reproduce the results of the paper “Cardiac behaviors and chaotic arrhythmias in the Hindmarsh-Rose model”, co-autored by Rafael V. Stenzinger, Tadeu E. Scalvin, Patrick A. Morelo and Marcelo H. R. Tragtenberg.

Codes can be compiled using GFortran or ifort and contain simple Gnuplot scripts to plot the results. Parameters to reproduce the results are in the figures, captions and/or in the main text of the paper.

KTz_cell.f90, from the previous repository 'Reentry_CML_KTz', reproduces Supplementary Fig. S1.

HR_cell_bifurc_APD_ISI.f90 calculates the bifurcation diagrams of the action potential duration (APD) and interspike interval (ISI) in Fig. 2. Fig. S2 can be generated by modifying this code with the diastolic interval (DI) condition.

HR_cell_phase_diagram_ISI.f90 is used to generate the HR phase diagrams in Figs. 3a, 3b, 8a, 8b, 8d, S3, S4, S5, S8 and S9. The hyperbolic KTz phase diagram of Figs. 3c and 3d can be reproduced using the code KTz_cell_phase_diagram_ISI.f90 from the 'Reentry_CML_KTz' repository by simply changing the logistic function to the hyperbolic tangent (commented in the code) and setting the parameters according to the figure.

HR_RK4.f90 is used for the membrane potential results of Figs. 1, 4, 5 and S10. It also contains the possibility to periodically stimulate the cell and calculate the 'electrocardiagram' (ECG), which can be used to reproduce Figs. 6, 7, 8c, S6 and S7 (the indicated parts of the code responsible for the stimulus and ECG can be ignored or commented out when generating Figs. 1, 4, 5 and S10).
